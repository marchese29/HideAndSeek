# Design Artifacts

AI-generated design documents and artifacts for the HideAndSeek game.

## Documents

- `data-model.md` — Server-side data model: transit data, game maps, games, players, location tracking, questions, and exclusion zones.

## Conventions

- Store design docs, wireframes, and specifications here.
- Use markdown for text-based design docs.
- Name files descriptively (e.g., `game-mechanics.md`, `map-ui-flow.md`).
- Mark documents with a status (Draft / Implementation / Done) and last-updated date.
