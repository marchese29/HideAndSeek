{"id":"HideAndSeek-8hu","title":"Opportunistic location updates on API actions","description":"Many API actions are made by players whose current location is known to the client. Rather than relying solely on the dedicated POST /games/{game_id}/location endpoint, we should accept an optional location field on relevant requests and treat it as an implicit location update.\n\nCandidate endpoints:\n- POST /games/{game_id}/questions (seeker asking a question — already needs seeker location)\n- POST /games/{game_id}/questions/{id}/lock-in (seeker locking in thermometer — uses latest location)\n- POST /games/{game_id}/questions/{id}/answer (hider answering — snapshots hider location)\n\nBenefits:\n- Reduces location staleness for critical game actions\n- Fewer dedicated location report round-trips needed\n- More accurate question answers since location is fresh at the moment of action\n\nImplementation:\n- Add optional 'coordinates' (GeoJSON Point) + 'timestamp' fields to relevant request schemas\n- When present, create a LocationUpdate before processing the main action\n- Use the fresh location instead of querying the latest stored one\n- Backward compatible: field is optional, existing behavior unchanged if omitted","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"dan@marchese.me","created_at":"2026-02-14T12:48:24.375382-08:00","created_by":"Dan Marchese","updated_at":"2026-02-14T12:48:33.733998-08:00"}
